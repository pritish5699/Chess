- Open index.html.
- Click on Start Button.
- On top of the chess board, you can see who's turn.
- You can reset the chess board.
- Click on any of your chess piece, it will show you valid moves.
- If you move piece to valid move, it will update chess board.
- If you do move piece to invalid move, piece will come back automcatically to original position.
- I did not provide random move functionality. Instead of that, it shows you all posible move when you click on any piece.
- It's not full chess game, since it is not checking the castle is under attack or not.
- Play it and Enjoy !!!
